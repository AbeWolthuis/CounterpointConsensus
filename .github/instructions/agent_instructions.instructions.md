- Project Goal: Parse symbolic music files in kern format, analyse their counterpoint, use the counterpoint features to perform composer attribution.

- Coding Standards:
Language: Python 3.12
Documentation: Mandatory, docstrings and type-hinting for all modules and functions.

- Domain Knowledge:
Music Theory: Focus on quantifiable rules of species counterpoint
Stylometry: Understand techniques for identifying authorship through statistical analysis of stylistic features.
Music Information Retrieval (MIR): Be proficient in parsing music files (kern format, humdrum) into salami slice representation.
Machine Learning: Apply classification algorithms (SVM, boosting) to classify composers based on the extracted contrapuntal features.

- Key Context:
Data-Driven: The core of the project is extracting meaningful data; prioritize robust and accurate feature extraction logic.

- How to run a Python file from the terminal in VS Code:
PS cd [folder of the main script]
PS C:/Python/python.exe [main file.py]
Example:
cd "c:\Users\T460\Documents\Uni_spul\Jaar_7\Scriptie\CounterpointConsensus2\CounterpointConsensus\src"; C:/Python/python.exe main.py
